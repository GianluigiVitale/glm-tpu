- Read `AGENTS.md`, `goal.md`, and `docs/glm-tpu-revolution.md` before this status file.

Those tracked branch-local files are authoritative. Main checkout, old worktree, campaign, and
legacy `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`HANDOFF.md` files have no authority here. The incremental TP32 plan
and pipeline-parallelism ban are superseded. Never edit/delete the owner's untracked main files.

## Implemented and verified

- Frozen, hashed geometry/topology/plan types; runtime physical discovery; deterministic PP8/PP16
  groups/rings; exact optimized-HLO parser with executable-partition-to-physical-device mapping.
- Complete protected 75-operation collective floor over physical 2/4/8/32-chip groups.
- Device-resident PP8/PP16 transport: closed physical lanes, exact point-to-point HLO, one compiled
  global program, deterministic checksums, warmed distributions, and fresh fleet XPlanes.
- Independent batch-one MoE reference: FP8 128x128 block dequant, FP32 sigmoid/noaux_tc routing,
  correction bias for selection only, exact lowest-id ties, normalized top-8, post-reduction 2.5
  scale, 64 complete experts/chip, and intermediate-sharded shared expert. Routed/shared partials
  share one four-chip combine without mixing value domains. Forced four-device distributed and
  all-top-4-on-one-chip cases pass bounded tensor equivalence; routing is elementwise exact.
- One-layer format/packer validates every source leaf and writes four final PP8 identity-owned
  files with complete expert ownership, shared-intermediate shards, replicated router state,
  payload/file/manifest checksums, finite checks, and append-only refusal. Tiny roundtrip/corruption
  tests pass. Real artifact `greenfield_one_layer_pack_20260805T151828912346032Z` packed 1,544
  layer-3 leaves / 9,706,940,416 unique source bytes from only shards 38–40 into four independently
  hashed 2,429,096,640-byte files. The 9,716,380,672-byte packed payload reconciles exactly,
  including intentional router replication. Manifest `68ef8201...f938`, approved-bucket upload,
  and local/remote `SUCCESS` pass at code `1969d925...f3d4`; this is layout evidence, not Gate B.
- Independent raw-source PyTorch oracle capture never imports the greenfield JAX kernels, packed
  checkpoint, model class, or legacy execution. Real artifact
  `greenfield_one_layer_oracle_20260805T162210370718434Z` pins 104 exact source tensors and accepted
  legacy/vLLM source hashes. Normal routes `[161,217,206,240,186,180,37,81]` span all four PP8
  slots; the adversarial routes are all experts 128–135 on slot 2. Manifest `c63ffa19...ebff`,
  274,944-byte safetensor SHA `4aa7910b...784b`, and local/remote `SUCCESS` pass at `27ebdec`.
- Direct PP8 loader validates every packed identity/hash, maps captured physical stage slots to the
  isolated runtime subcube, transfers 56 already-owned shards, and performs all 24 FP8 lookup/scale
  conversions on device. It performs zero host FP8 dequantizations and zero host global concats.
- Protected PP8 layer-3 metal proof DB 417 / `greenfield_real_layer_pp8_20260805T165737737514245Z`
  passed both oracle cases at code `db19893`. Normal/concentrated p50 wall is `0.696215/1.134090 ms`
  over 1,000 profiler-free samples after 200 warmups. Routes are elementwise exact; both output
  comparisons have max `0.03125`, p99 `0.01171875`, and mean below `0.00236` BF16 absolute error.
  Optimized HLO SHA `950b5eb2...977d` contains exactly one
  `bf16[2,1,6144]` all-reduce over `{{0,1,2,3}}` and no other collective. HBM after timing is
  `4,860,038,656` bytes/chip with `5,639,681,536` measured peak against `33,014,413,312` available.
  A fresh 20-step/8-core XPlane observes exactly one physical `psum` per step. All hashes, DB
  integrity, approved archive, remote `SUCCESS`, and authenticated 8/8 post-census pass.
- Final-layout PP16 artifact `greenfield_one_layer_pack_pp16_20260805T172003732526347Z` writes
  two independently hashed 4,855,045,080-byte files at pack code `51d1df9`: experts
  `0:128/128:256`, shared intermediate `0:1024/1024:2048`, manifest
  `38573723...e454`, the same immutable source revision, exact source/payload reconciliation,
  and approved-bucket `SUCCESS`.
- Protected PP16 DB 418 / `greenfield_real_layer_pp16_20260805T172807177182695Z` passed at
  `6751a93`. Normal/concentrated p50 is `0.900610/1.075795 ms`; routes are exact and
  output max/p99/mean errors are at most `0.03125/0.0078125/0.002141`. HLO SHA
  `f9a97fbb...d051` contains exactly one `bf16[2,1,6144]` all-reduce over
  `{{0,1}}`. Peak HBM is `11,276,493,312` bytes/chip; the fresh 4-core/20-step XPlane
  has exactly one physical all-reduce on all 80 core-steps. DB, archive, hashes, and 8/8 pre/post
  census pass.
- Complete inventory/plan/layout maps all 118,629 source leaves / 755,617,140,416 bytes to 32 PP8
  base owners plus four MTP owners. Full pack `greenfield_full_pack_pp8_20260805T182222755355852Z`
  contains 760,215,571,712 payload bytes; packed manifest is `08694931...78f1` and the approved
  checkpoint prefix has `SUCCESS`.
- Protected DB 420 / `greenfield_full_checkpoint_load_pp8_20260805T201317772639405Z` directly
  loaded all 32 base owners / 750,122,559,744 bytes on all 32 chips at `91a8c47`. All 122,640 final
  shards pass identity, finite, physical ownership, and device-roundtrip checks; host FP8 dequant,
  global concat, and runtime reshard counts are zero. Maximum weights-only HBM is 24,840,958,464
  bytes/chip with at least 8,173,454,848 free. Ledger, DB integrity, three 8/8 censuses, approved
  archive, and an independent byte-for-byte download of all 47 files pass. Gate B is complete.
- Exact reference RMSNorm/final norm, dense/SwiGLU/residual/embedding/logits, accepted RoPE, FP32
  DSA scorer, exact lowest-global-position ties, distributed exact top-k, stage-local striped KV
  lookup, sparse MLA/LSE merge, and compact IndexShare carriage are implemented at `10e5097`.
  Full-width FP32 and BF16 comparisons against the pinned legacy sparse-attention oracle are
  elementwise exact, including the four-owner BF16 merge. These reference tests prove semantics
  only; the protected real TPU result is recorded below. No decoder, serving, decoder-HBM, or
  genuine token-throughput result exists.
- Independent raw-source Gate C oracle
  `greenfield_gate_c_oracle_20260805T212801776974822Z` passed at `602d42f`. It consumes 31 exact
  layer-2/3 tensors from source shards 20/38/40, never imports JAX/model/legacy execution, and
  captures real dense, full-DSA, and IndexShare-reuse cases. The 2,304-position full scorer selects
  exactly 2,048 unique positions including current position 2,303; layer 3 reuses the identical
  score-ordered `int32[1,2048]` state (8,192 bytes), privately sorts only for attention, and proves
  write-before-attend. The 36,060,088-byte safetensor is `a8927db...0364`; manifest is
  `54262529...4a9f`; local/remote `SUCCESS` and the local evidence ledger pass. This is an
  independent correctness artifact, not TPU or performance proof.
- Bounded final-owner Gate C checkpoint
  `greenfield_gate_c_pack_20260805T214609093206269Z` passed at `8a50d6a`. It is an exact
  content-addressed subset of protected full layout `aca0eb6d...6a0` and oracle
  `54262529...4a9f`: 31/31 raw leaves from shards 20/38/40 are hashed while streaming once, with
  413,810,816 unique source bytes becoming four equal 125,611,520-byte PP8 stage-0 payloads.
  Packed payload/file totals are 502,446,080/502,461,536 bytes; layout is `cdbea04f...c678` and
  packed manifest is `3c5c48da...2a8a`. All four file hashes, the sealed local ledger, remote
  size/generation/CRC32C, approved-bucket archive, and local/remote `SUCCESS` pass. This removes
  the need to load ~92 GB of complete stage-0 owner files for Gate C but is not a TPU result.
- Protected DB 421 / `greenfield_gate_c_pp8_20260805T224645828157364Z` passed real dense,
  full-DSA, and IndexShare TPU execution at exact code `dc20b3f` on physical PP8 stage 0
  (worker 2). It directly loads 502,446,080 packed bytes with 124 final-owner transfers, 44
  device FP8 dequantizations, and zero host dequant/global concat/runtime reshard. Dense output
  max error is `0.00390625`; DSA score max/mean is `0.003605/0.000965`; IndexShare output max/mean
  is `0.0078125/0.000167`. DSA selection and lowest-position tie order are elementwise exact for
  the actual TPU FP32 score row, the 8,192-byte score-ordered state is fed directly to IndexShare,
  and cache/state integrity is exact. Optimized HLO is strictly four-chip local: dense `0AG/1AR`,
  DSA `3AG/0AR`, and TPU-rewritten IndexShare `2AG/3AR`, all over `{{0,1,2,3}}`. A fresh trace has
  20 invocations/case on eight cores and matches the HLO-derived physical collective counts.
  Peak HBM is 280,745,984 bytes/chip for this bounded layer proof. DB integrity, sealed ledger,
  approved archive/SUCCESS, and 8/8 pre/post census pass. This is correctness/mechanism evidence,
  not latency or tok/s evidence.
- The independent PyTorch CPU oracle and TPU scorer are not bitwise-identical: bounded FP32 score
  drift changes two members of the 2,048-of-2,304 cutoff set (2,046 overlap) and therefore many
  score-order positions. This is preserved as an explicit non-relaxed diagnostic. The runtime does
  not use CPU positions: it selects exactly from actual TPU scores and carries that exact state.
  Do not claim raw cross-framework position identity from DB 421.
- Gate D code is at `a2638a2`. The executable-ready runtime layout consumes the protected DB420
  owner files exactly: 32/32 files, 122,640/122,640 leaves, and 750,122,559,744/750,122,559,744
  source bytes match by name/dtype/shape/bytes. Its 364 uniform stage-slot tensors occupy
  26,068,042,432 bytes/chip; padding is explicit (1,237,233,344–3,719,717,632 bytes/chip), raw FP8
  stays U8, and the offline derivative streams/hashes with bounded host memory. With padded 256K
  state (1,090,555,904) and the protected one-layer temporary floor (779,642,880), modeled
  precompile occupancy is 27,938,241,216 bytes/chip, leaving 5,076,172,096 before the still-unknown
  executable/overlay. A complete raw-FP8 layer shares q_a between DSA/attention and composes
  dense/MoE residual math exactly. The generic one-step program executes all eight stages, owned
  cache writes, and compact transport in one 32-device map. Its forced-CPU eight-layer proof returns
  the one live row with exact state and HLO `56AG/16AR/16CP`, all four-chip/lane-local, no dead rows.
  Suites are 212/212 greenfield plus 28/28 protection tests. This is CPU mechanism/memory-model
  evidence only: the real 78-layer checkpoint has not been runtime-packed, compiled, or run on TPU;
  no decoder HBM, latency, token, or tok/s claim exists.

## Protected evidence

Topology DB 405 / `greenfield_topology_20260805T125842425591441Z` proved 32 v4 chips in `2x4x4`,
actual local ordering, topology hash `294e777...559`, PP8 `d5943ab8...c14`, PP16
`6383e57c...f21`, remote `SUCCESS`, and 8/8 clean census.

Collective DB 406–414 all have approved archives and clean census. Dominant `bf16[2,6144]` p50 for
75 all-reduces is g2/g4/g8/g32 `0.836/1.083/1.471/3.941 ms`; 75 full-ring permutes are `0.791 ms`.
The matrix covers required bf16 shapes, `f32[1,6144]`, and `int32[1,2048]` metadata. Small decode
reduce-scatter is not falsely timed: TPU XLA rewrites it to all-reduce, and three diagnostics fail
closed with saved HLO.

Transport DB 415 / `greenfield_transport_20260805T142953361259007Z` passed 16 cases at `577aa4b`:

- One invocation carries every rank-dependent payload through every stage and back to its exact
  lane origin. HLO contains exactly 8 PP8 or 16 PP16 neighbor `collective-permute` operations with
  exact bf16/int32 shapes and pairs. It contains no all-reduce/gather/to-all/reduce-scatter, host
  staging, Ray/Python stage dispatch, or model-equivalent compute.
- `bf16[1,6144]` fleet-max profiler-free p50: PP8 `0.331145 ms` vs `0.300895` control
  (`0.030250 ms` net); PP16 `0.407385` vs `0.331230` (`0.076155 ms` net). Other payloads are
  approximately `0.024–0.077 ms` net. This is synthetic mechanism latency, not token speed.
- Approved archive `SUCCESS`, DB linkage, full distributions, provenance, and 8/8 cleanup pass.

Trace DB 416 / `greenfield_transport_trace_20260805T143832942547470Z` passed at `8aee335`:

- Both plans have 8 fresh XPlanes, 64 TPU cores, and exactly 20 selected steps/core.
- Every PP8 core reports exactly 8 permute starts + 8 dones/step; PP16 reports 16 + 16;
  forbidden collective count is zero. Trace-contaminated timing is excluded from latency claims.
- Archive, hashes, DB snapshot, authenticated pre/post zero census, and remote `SUCCESS` pass.

Real layer DB 417 / `greenfield_real_layer_pp8_20260805T165737737514245Z` passed at `db19893`:

- The loader consumes the bounded final-ownership PP8 pack directly; no host dequant/global concat.
- Normal p50/p90/p95/p99 is `0.696215/0.716489/0.722115/0.742864 ms`; concentrated is
  `1.134090/1.155466/1.163958/1.195100 ms`. These are profiler-free one-layer wall distributions,
  not token throughput. The concentrated distribution has one retained `40.141 ms` host outlier.
- Exact routes, bounded tensor comparison, one local four-rank HLO collective, per-chip HBM, a fresh
  post-timing XPlane, append-only DB/archive, checksums, and 8/8 clean pre/post census all pass.

Real layer DB 418 / `greenfield_real_layer_pp16_20260805T172807177182695Z` passed at
`6751a93`:

- The two-chip stage is captured physical stage 10, global ids `[4,5]`, coordinates
  `[(0,2,0),(1,2,0)]`. Final-owner load performs 28 direct transfers, 12 device
  dequantizations, zero host dequant/global concat, and owns 128 complete experts plus shared width
  1024 per chip.
- Normal p50/p90/p95/p99 is `0.900610/0.919235/0.925838/0.949264 ms`; concentrated is
  `1.075795/1.093593/1.101284/1.156754 ms`. Exactly one local two-rank combine is present.
- HBM after timing is `9,710,615,552` bytes/chip; measured peak is `11,276,493,312` of
  `33,014,413,312`. Correctness, HLO, wall, fresh trace, DB/archive, and cleanup all pass.

Full load DB 420 / `greenfield_full_checkpoint_load_pp8_20260805T201317772639405Z` passed at
`91a8c47`:

- All eight standalone stages resolved from captured topology and loaded all 32 final base owners.
  Stage payloads are 89.393–99.323 GB; per-chip peak is 22.357–24.841 GB.
- Raw FP8 U8 plus local FP32 scales remain in final ownership. File/tensor SHA, finite checks,
  byte totals, device round trips, state manifests, DB integrity, archive, and three 8/8 censuses
  pass. The independently downloaded 47-file archive is byte-identical to local evidence.
- This is load integrity, not decode. `promotion_memory_proven=false`: the 8.173 GB minimum free is
  before KV, DSA state, executables/overlays, and decoder temporaries. It has no tok/s claim.

Gate C DB 421 / `greenfield_gate_c_pp8_20260805T224645828157364Z` passed at `dc20b3f`:

- The direct bounded load binds packed manifest `3c5c48da...2a8a`, layout
  `cdbea04f...c678`, and independent oracle `54262529...4a9f`; all load fast-path counters pass.
- Dense/full-DSA/IndexShare outputs are bounded against the raw oracle. Exact device-score top-k,
  tie order, 8,192-byte IndexShare carriage, write-before-attend, selected KV, live cache, and
  state reuse pass. Raw CPU-oracle selection has 2,046/2,048 set overlap because the two
  FP32 implementations differ near the cutoff; it is diagnostic only and is not silently relaxed.
- HLO and fresh XPlane prove only local four-rank collectives with exact per-case counts. Maximum
  bounded-proof peak HBM is 280,745,984 bytes/chip. DB/archive/ledger and 8/8 cleanup pass.
- This is Gate C layer correctness/mechanism evidence, not a full decoder or token-speed result.

Rejected DB 419 / `greenfield_full_checkpoint_load_pp8_20260805T194526167625636Z` is preserved but
never promotable: its first harness appended to `orchestrator.log` after hashing it, so its local
ledger failed. DB 420 is a fresh run using the corrected seal-before-success harness.

Rejected diagnostic `greenfield_real_layer_pp16_20260805T172345348528631Z` proved that
libtpu cannot initialize local devices `0,1` as a standalone `2x1x1` slice: the driver
reports duplicate coordinate assignment. Its driver logs are archived and it has no DB/performance
claim. A protected subset diagnostic then proved the correct runtime: initialize the known-good
`2x2` host subcube while placing arrays/executable only on adjacent devices `0,1`; DB
418 uses that exact mechanism.

Rejected diagnostic `...T143608529930365Z` has no DB/status claim: valid distinct rank traces were
downloaded into worker-0's original local trace tree, causing a duplicate-host parser refusal. The
fixed proof uses an isolated canonical fleet directory; it did not reinterpret the failed result.

## Interpretation

Legacy attributes `106.495 ms/token` to 75 full-pod MoE combines (`1.420 ms/layer`), while exact
75-op full-pod all-reduce needs `3.941 ms` and an entire PP8 residual ring costs only `0.331 ms`.
The old loss is therefore arrival skew, reshard/layout work, barrier waiting, and surrounding
decomposition—not raw 12 KiB ICI or stage-transfer bandwidth. Primitive replacement alone is not
enough; stage-local model layout remains the structural requirement.

## Exact next sequence

1. Finish the protected runtime-checkpoint derivative/loader, bind its 364 global device-sharded
   arrays plus padded state to the all-stage program, and compile the real 78-layer 2K form. Add
   embedding/final-norm/distributed logits/token control, then prove the complete 2K/8K Gate-D
   decoder with raw tokens, exact DSA/cache state, local-only HLO, measured HBM, fresh trace, and
   profiler-free steady wall. Do not attempt 256K until this short-context sequence passes.
2. Continue Gates E–H in binding order. The one-layer
   comparison provisionally favors PP8 for
   normal routing (`0.696` vs `0.901 ms`) while PP16 wins the concentrated adversary
   (`1.076` vs `1.134 ms`); only complete protected decoder evidence may choose the
   final plan.

The pod ended the latest proof with all eight hosts `CENSUS_OK`.
