# RESEARCH LOG — GLM-5.2 on TPU v4

Append a dated entry every session (newest first). Mirror the DSV4 log (`~/moe-tpu/docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md`):
what you did, what you validated it against, the exact numbers, and the honest nulls.

## 2026-07-06 — Repo initialized (starting point; nothing ported yet)
- Created `glm-tpu` as the GLM-5.2 porting harness (the moe-tpu sibling): `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `PLAN.md`,
  `docs/00-feasibility-memo.md` (the config-verified GO study), dir scaffold, `.env` gitignored.
- `setup.sh --folder=glm-tpu` wired; repo on GitHub (`GianluigiVitale/glm-tpu`, private).
- Target confirmed: **`zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8`** (FP8-native, ~744 GB — fits 1024 GB HBM; BF16 ~1.5 TB does not).
  `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM`, 753B/40B, MLA + DSA (index_topk=2048, 32 indexer heads, IndexShare), 1M context.
- Cost geography established: pod + storage must be **us-central2** (`gs://driftbench-dsv4-uc`); the EU
  `gs://driftbench-storage` bucket was the June bill driver — never put GLM weights there.
- **Benchmark + provenance machinery pre-built (CPU, no model yet)** so Stage 1 starts ready: `bench/`
  (`provenance.py` = the SQLite DB storing every question/timestamp/reply/pass-fail + run-level provenance;
  `benchmarks.py` registry; `extract.py`; `run_bench.py` with a pluggable `make_generate()`; `download_data.py`;
  `test_bench.py` **all CPU tests pass**). Datasets **cached** (13 MB): MMLU-Pro (12032), GSM8K (1319),
  AIME-2026 (30). Pipeline validated end-to-end on real data via `--stub`. **GPQA-Diamond gated** → [OWNER]
  request access at the HF dataset page (or use an ungated mirror). `CARD_TARGETS` holds all 20 HF-card values.
- NEXT: Stage 1 (see HANDOFF) — fork GLM branch, stage FP8 → us-central2, register the arch, dense-MLA
  correctness, then wire `make_generate()` to the engine and reproduce the first benchmark (data + DB ready).
